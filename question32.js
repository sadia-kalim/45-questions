/*Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites
 ensure that everyone has a unique username.
 • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
 • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the
 new usernames are also in the current_users list.
 
 • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used.
  If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a
  username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.*/
